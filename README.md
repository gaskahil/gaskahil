<!-- TO DO: add more details about me later -->

## My Coding Journey
In the fall of 2024, I took part in an HTML introductory course hosted by _NITO_. I also downloaded Sololearn where I learned more HTML, CSS and some SQL basics.<br/> At the start of 2025, I studied at _Oslos Nye Fagskole_, where I studied Frontend and Backend Essentials. The repository named **PRO1001-Exam** is my exam project for my Frontend course, and the repository **PRO1002-exam-Backend** is my exam project for the Backend course.
